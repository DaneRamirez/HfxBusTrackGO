## Security Notes üîí
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Warning 

- This project contains temporary SSL workarounds for development purposes:

- Self-Signed Certificates Generated during setup for local HTTPS server

- API Verification Bypass
Disabled SSL verification for Halifax Transit's API:

```python
response = requests.get(url, verify=False)
```
- Mixed-Content Handling
Browser security exceptions required for local testing

## Production Requirements
For public deployment, you must:

- Obtain valid certificates from a trusted CA

- Remove verify=False from API requests

- Configure proper SSL settings:

```python
Copy
context = (
    "/etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURDOMAIN.COM/fullchain.pem",
    "/etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURDOMAIN.COM/privkey.pem"
)
```
- Use a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with security headers
